# 🌊 The Blue Spine: Spatiotemporal Analysis of Urban Cooling Island Intensity

## 📖 Project Overview
Tianjin, a megacity in Northern China, faces intensifying Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects due to rapid urbanization. While the Haihe River ("The Mother River") acts as a critical blue space, its specific cooling capacity remains unquantified for recent years.

This project utilizes **Landsat 8/9 satellite imagery (2020–2025)** to quantify the micro-climatic regulation of the Haihe River. Instead of traditional global statistics, this repository implements an automated **Python workflow** and **Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)** to model the spatial heterogeneity of the cooling effect, providing evidence-based metrics for urban resilience planning.

## 🚀 Key Features (Technical Highlights)

- **Automated LST Retrieval**  
  A custom Python script (using ArcPy) to batch-process Level-2 Landsat thermal bands, converting DN values to Celsius and applying cloud masking.

- **Spatial Heterogeneity Modeling**  
  Implementation of **GWR (Geographically Weighted Regression)** to identify local variations in the cooling effect, overcoming the limitations of **OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)**.

- **Water Body Extraction**  
  Automated **NDWI** calculation to dynamically delineate the Haihe River boundary across different years.

- **Threshold Calculation**  
  Statistical analysis to determine the maximum **Cooling Threshold Distance** (e.g., how many meters inland the cooling effect reaches).

## 🛠️ Methodology & Workflow

### Data Acquisition
- **Source:** USGS EarthExplorer (Landsat 8/9 OLI/TIRS Level-2 Science Products)  
- **Timeframe:** Summer months (June–September), 2020–2025  
- **Study Area:** The 6 central districts of Tianjin (Heping, Nankai, Hexi, etc.)

### Preprocessing (Python / ArcPy)
- Batch cloud masking using the `QA_PIXEL` band  
- Geometric clipping to the study area boundary  

### Analysis (Spatial Statistics)
- **LST Retrieval:**  
  \[
  Temperature = (ST\_B10 \times 0.0034172 + 149.0) - 273.15
  \]

- **GWR Modeling:**  
  - Dependent Variable: LST  
  - Explanatory Variable: Euclidean Distance to River  

### Visualization
- Generation of Cooling Coefficient Maps  
- Generation of Threshold Curves
